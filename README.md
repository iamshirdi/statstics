# statstics cheat sheet notes

## LINEAR RELATIONSHIP
- When y =mx+b the large constant is added to small . it dominates small which will result in price per unit large compared to when constant is large and y is also large . y dominates so price per unit is small compared to when y is small
- Its like **fixed fee - constant-b** even wether you buy small or large. While you profit per sqm if you buy high cost house compared to small cost with constant fee
- The higher price (y) we go the constant price becomes negligible for a given x (sqm)
- Scatter plot is not good for noisy data unlike barchart
- Noise can be due to numerous reasons like old house, remodelling, view,area which are not included. Which resulted in non linear relationship between size and cost (cost should increase with size)

- BAR Chart pool together and make half in y axis. It helps in large data pool find wether increasing or decreasing as shown in image

- Histograms are kind of barchat (2D) which focuses on 1D data. usually frequency-count on y axis. Example: Majority of salary in one bin and minority in another bin. Similarly age distribution
- Pie chart is used for specifically relative data (percentage)
